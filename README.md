### Hour Logger -- A way to keep track of time 

### Purpose
The purpose of this application is to create an easy way to streamline the logging of hours members of my school FRC Robotics Team were at meetings.

### Audience
this app was specifically created for our uses but can be reused by anyone who needs to cdllect time data on members of any group.
### Tools
This app is written in Java using Intellij IDEA as an IDE. Many different third party libraries were used to accomplish tasks in the most efficient way, including [QRGen](https://github.com/kenglxn/QRGen),[Apache Common-CSV](https://github.com/apache/commons-csv), [Webcam Capture](https://github.com/sarxos/webcam-capture), [ZXing](https://github.com/zxing/zxing) and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) to put it all together. By far the most useful tool out of these way Intellij IDEA's UI Designer that helped make creating the User Interface for the program a breeze
